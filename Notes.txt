Change MTU of second link between Router_A and Host_2 to 30, packets now need to be fragmented
Extend the network layer:
  -extend classes including packet format in network.py to match IP's mechanisms for packet segmentation and reconstruction

From Textbook:
When destination host receives series of datagrams from same source:
  1) need to determine if any of the datagrams are fragments
  2) Has it received the last fragment?
  3) How should the received fragments be pieced back together?

Put Identification flag and fragmentation offset fields in the IP datagram header
When datagram created, sending host stamps datagram with id number, source and destination address
Typically the sending hosts increments the id number for each datagram it sends

When a router needs to fragment a datagram, each resulting fragment is stamped with source address, destination address, and id number of original datagram. 
When destination receives series of datagrams from same sending host, can examine id numbers of datagrams to determine which of datagrams are actually fragments of the same larger datagram
Last fragment has a flag bit set to 0, all others have flag bit set to 1

To determine whether a datagram is missing, and to reassemble in proper order, offset field is used to specify where fragment fits in original datagram

PART 3:
1) Configure simulation.py to reflect the network topology: DONE
2) Create routing tables so Host1 and Host2 can send to Host3
-routing table for each router should be passed into router constructor, should be defined in simulation.py
    -need to modify router class to forward packets correctly between interfaces according to routing tables
3)Extend NetworkPacket with source address: DONE
4)Forward Packets from Host1 over Router B and from Host2 over Router C
